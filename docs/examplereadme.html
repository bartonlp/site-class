<h1 id="examples">Examples</h1>
<p>I have included a couple of examples to show how to use the SiteClass.</p>
<p>First you will need to install mysql if you don't already have it. You will need to install the PHP extension for mysql. The SiteClass code runs with PHP 8 so it may not work with older versions of PHP.</p>
<p>Once you have mysql and the PHP extension you can set up mysql. These examples use a database called 'barton' with user 'barton'. There is a file in this directory called schema.sql. You can run it in mysql and create the database and the tables.</p>
<p>There is a <em>mysitemap.json</em> file in the directory above this. It has the setup information and is pretty well documented. Oh, it is really not a true <em>json</em> file as it can contain comments. After I remove the comments programatcally it is a true <em>json</em> file which I run throush json_decode() so it must be valid <em>json</em>.</p>
<p>I have set up a .htaccess file which has a RewriteRule to redirect a css file to <em>tracker.php</em> for tracking.</p>
<p>The 'examples' directory should have everything you will need to run the examples including header, banner and footer files as well as css, images and fonts.</p>
<p>Now that the database is set up you can run the examples.</p>
<p>If you are just trying this out you can use the PHP server: <code>PHP -S localhost:8080</code>. You can change the port to what you want.<br />
Then use your browser to go to: <code>localhost:8080/&lt;AN_EXAMPLE_FILE&gt;</code>. See the example programs in the examples directory.</p>

<p>Have fun</p>
