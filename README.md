# SiteClass Verion 3.8.0

**SiteClass** is a PHP mini framework for simple, small websites. It can be esaly combined with other frameworks or templeting engines if needed. 
For small websites I feel that frameworks like Laravel or Meteor etc. are just too much.

See [github.com/bartonlp/site-class](https://github.com/bartonlp/site-class) for a full list of changes.

You can check the versions of the framework: [Get Versions](https://bartonphillips.com/articles/showVersions.php)  
Or [Get Versions](https://bartonlp.com/otherpages/getVersions.php)

This project has several parts that can function standalone or combined.
