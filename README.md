# SiteClass Verion 5.0.0 PDO

**SiteClass** is a PHP mini framework for my websites. It is customized for my websites and will be hard for someone else to use it.
I have a new class, **SimpleSiteClass** that is designed for anyone. 
It is at [https://github.com/bartonlp/simple-site-class](https://github.com/bartonlp/simple-site-class). 
Documentation for the [SimpleSiteClass](https://bartonlp.github.io/simple-site-class/).

If you are still interested in exploring **SiteClass**, read on.

**SiteClass** can be esaly combined with other frameworks or templeting engines if needed. 
For small websites I feel that frameworks like Laravel or Meteor etc. are just too much.

**SiteClass** now uses PDO to do its database work. It has been tested with *mysql* and *sqlite* drivers.
See the *dbPdo.class.php* file for more information.

See [github.com/bartonlp/site-class](https://github.com/bartonlp/site-class) for a full list of changes.
There are now three branches: *master*, *new* and *pdo*. This is in the *pdo* branch.

You can check the versions of the framework: [Get Versions](https://bartonphillips.com/articles/showVersions.php)  
Or [Get Versions](https://bartonlp.com/otherpages/getVersions.php)

This project has several parts that can function standalone or combined.
