# Examples

I have included a couple of examples to show how to use the SiteClass.

First you will need to install mysql if you don't already have it. You will need to install the PHP extension for mysql. The SiteClass code
runs with PHP 8, it may not work with older versions of PHP.

Once you have mysql and the PHP extension you can set up mysql. These examples use a database called 'barton' with user 'barton'. There is
a file in this directory called schema.sql. You can run it in mysql and create the database and the tables.

Now that the database is set up you can run the examples.
